Tutorial for begineers to learn how to use OnwTech's TWIST/SPIN board

Original version "Tutoriel carte Twist-JULIEN" in French.

I'm updating it by translating and adding some other explanations.

Updates:
- Fully updated and translated up to Buck closed-loop.
- Boards calibration spreadsheet added to serve as a basis for other boards calibration.
